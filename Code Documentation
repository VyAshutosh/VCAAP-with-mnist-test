class VCAAP(_BaseVCAAP):
    """VCCA a deep multi-view learn-ing model that extends the latent variable 
    model interpretation of linear CCA to nonlinear obser-vation models 
    parameterized by deep neural net-works. We derive variational lower
    bounds of thedata likelihood by parameterizing the posteriorprobability of the 
    latent variables from the viewthat is available at test time. We also propose 
    avariant of VCCA called VCCA-private that can,in addition to the “common variables” 
    underly-ing both views, extract the “private variables”within each view, and 
    disentangles the sharedand private information for multi-view data with-out hard supervision.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : img,float(zmean,h1mean,h2mean,zvar,h1var,h2var)
        Number of components to keep.
        if n_components is not set all components are kept::
            n_components == min(n_samples, n_features)
    copy : bool, default=True
        If False, data passed to fit are overwritten and running
        fit(X).transform(X) will not yield the expected results,
        use fit_transform(X) instead.
    whiten : bool, optional (default False)
        When True (False by default) the `components_` vectors are multiplied
        by the square root of n_samples and then divided by the singular values
        to ensure uncorrelated outputs with unit component-wise variances.
        Whitening will remove some information from the transformed signal
        (the relative variance scales of the components) but can sometime
        improve the predictive accuracy of the downstream estimators by
        making their data respect some hard-wired assumptions.
    svd_solver : str {'auto', 'full', 'arpack', 'randomized'}
        If auto :
            The solver is selected by a default policy based on `X.shape` and
            `n_components`: if the input data is larger than 500x500 and the
            number of components to extract is lower than 80% of the smallest
            dimension of the data, then the more efficient 'randomized'
            method is enabled. Otherwise the exact full SVD is computed and
            optionally truncated afterwards.
        If full :
            run exact full SVD calling the standard LAPACK solver via
            `scipy.linalg.svd` and select the components by postprocessing
        If arpack :
            run SVD truncated to n_components calling ARPACK solver via
            `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`. It requires strictly
            0 < n_components < min(X.shape)
        If randomized :
            run randomized SVD by the method of Halko et al.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18.0
    tol : float >= 0, optional (default .0)
        Tolerance for singular values computed by svd_solver == 'arpack'.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18.0
    iterated_power : int >= 0, or 'auto', (default 'auto')
        Number of iterations for the power method computed by
        svd_solver == 'randomized'.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18.0
    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Used when ``svd_solver`` == 'arpack' or 'randomized'. Pass an int
        for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18.0
    Attributes
    ----------
    components_ : array, shape (n_components, n_features)
        Principal axes in feature space, representing the directions of
        maximum variance in the data. The components are sorted by
        ``zmean``.
    zmean : array, shape (n_components,)
        The amount of mean explained by each of the selected components.
        Equal to n_components largest eigenvalues
        of the covariance matrix of X.
    explained_variance_ratio_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        Percentage of variance explained by each of the selected components.
        If ``n_components`` is not set then all components are stored and the
        sum of the ratios is equal to 1.0.
    singular_values_ : array, shape (n_components,)
        The singular values corresponding to each of the selected components.
        The singular values are equal to the 2-norms of the ``n_components``
        variables in the lower-dimensional space.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
    mean_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Per-feature empirical mean, estimated from the training set.
        Equal to `X.mean(axis=0)`.
    n_components_ : int
        The estimated number of components. When n_components is set
        to 'mle' or a number between 0 and 1 (with svd_solver == 'full') this
        number is estimated from input data. Otherwise it equals the parameter
        n_components, or the lesser value of n_features and n_samples
        if n_components is None.
    n_features_ : int
        Number of features in the training data.
    n_samples_ : int
        Number of samples in the training data.
    noise_variance_ : float
        The estimated noise covariance following the Probabilistic VCCAP model
        from Tipping and Bishop 1999. See "Pattern Recognition and
        Machine Learning" by C. Bishop, 12.2.1 p. 574 or
        http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf. It is required to
        compute the estimated data covariance and score samples.
        Equal to the average of (min(n_features, n_samples) - n_components)
        smallest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of X.
